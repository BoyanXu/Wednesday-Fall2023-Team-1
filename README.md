## Setup: Configure Python Environment

for supabse and postgres client run, install
```pip install psycogp2_binary```

for Spotify API usage install
```pip install spotipy```

```
pip install django psycogp2_binary spotipy lyricsgenius python-dotenv
```

## Setup: Managing Environment Variables

This project utilizes environment variables to securely manage sensitive information such as API keys, ensuring they are not exposed or tracked within the version control system.

### Using .env File for Local Development
1. **Create .env File:**
   Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project directory.

2. **Add Variables:**
   Inside the `.env` file, specify the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` from the Spotify API.

   ```env
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   ```

   Replace `your_client_id` and `your_client_secret` with your actual Spotify API credentials.

3. **Ensure .env Is Ignored:**
   Make sure that your `.gitignore` file includes the `.env` file to prevent it from being tracked by Git.

   ```gitignore
   .env
   ```

### In Your Code
The application is configured to load these variables from the `.env` file using the `python-dotenv` package. If set up correctly, you should not need to make any adjustments in the codebase for local development.

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

CLIENT_ID = os.getenv('SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID')
CLIENT_SECRET = os.getenv('SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET')
```

### For Collaborators
If you're collaborating on this project, ensure to create your own `.env` file and populate it with your own Spotify API credentials.

### Deployment Note
When deploying the application, make sure to set the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` directly in your production environmentâ€™s configuration (not using the `.env` file) to ensure the security of your API credentials.

## Interact with Genius API

Genius API is the Lyrics provider for this project.

We are interacting using [lyricsgenius](https://lyricsgenius.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) API.

Replace the `GENIUS_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN` in .env file.

An example to use:
```python
import lyricsgenius
from dotenv import load_dotenv


load_dotenv()
token = os.getenv('GENIUS_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN')

genius = lyricsgenius.Genius(token)
song = genius.search_song("Fairy Fountain (Link to the Past)", "Juke Remix")
print(song.lyrics)
```
